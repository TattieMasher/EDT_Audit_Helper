**THIS PROJECT WAS MADE FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE AT MY WORK.**

# EDT_Audit_Helper

I work as a Service Desk Analyst in the healthcare tech industry. 

For auditing purposes, we regularly review patient documents delivered between Health Boards which have been passed through NHS-owned servers, which we maintain.
These documents are pre-processed by the NHS before they reach these servers and have filenames of **sender-prefix_**documentID.**fileExtension**.

In order to assist with this task, I have created this little java applet to obtain the document IDs (documents' primary keys) from their filnames.
